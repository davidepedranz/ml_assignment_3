\section{MNIST Handwritten Digits}
\label{sec:mnist}

The MNIST is a database of handwritten digits.
It is composed by a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples, both available on the website of Yann LeCun\footnote{\url{http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/}}.
The digits have been size-normalized to 20x20 pixel and centered in a fixed-size image of 28x28 pixel.
The images are in black and white, so their depth is equal to 1.
