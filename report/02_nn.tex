\section{Neural Networks}
\label{sec:nn}

The building block of each Neural Network is the perceptron.
A perceptron is a unit of computation that takes many inputs and compute an output, which is usually the result of the application of some activation function to the weighted sum of the inputs.
In other words, a perceptron computes the dot product between the inputs and some learned weights, i.e.\ it measures the similarity between the input and some internal representation.

Perceptron are organized in layers, which in turn form a network.
Each network can have a different number of layers and each layer can have a different number of perceptrons.
Some of the main types of layers include ``Fully Connected'', ``Softmax'', ``Convolutional'' and ``Pooling''.

In the following sections, we will examine how this layers are build and what is their function in a Deep Network for handwritten digits recognition.
