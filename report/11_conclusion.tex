\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

None of the proposed modification achieved to improve the accuracy of the original network.
The results are summarized in table \cref{tab:summary}.
The two layers of convolution were able to extract better features then the single layers of models 1 and 2.
The worse performances of model 3 suggest the need of at least one Fully Connected layer to learn how to combine the features extracted by the previous layers in order to make accurate predicitons.
